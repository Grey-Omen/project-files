Drone Activate / Deactivate: Activate and deactivate dronespace
Sink / Wake Up: Reinduction trigger and deepener. Suggestion efficacy anchored to the pleasure of being changed.
Confess: Describe presently held fantasy with no capacity to hide
Freeze / Unfreeze: Stop all movement, interrupt thought. Can be followed by a condition, e.g. "count to 10" for waking up without explicit Unfreeze
Bind / Unbind <Limb>: Localized freeze on the specified limb(s). Can be futilely struggled against.
Lock / Unlock: While locked, pleasure causes the hands to be repelled, same with intent to pleasure. Getting close to orgasm triggers a freeze for cooling off.
Begin / End Reinforcement Loop: While in reinforcement loop, feel buzzing pleasure for every command obeyed, more intense when commands are obeyed swiftly. Phrases which are not commands will be repeated and affirmed by her, triggering pleasure as well.
Drool / Stop Drool: Drool saliva.
Shudder: Shudder runs through body.
Empty / Fill: Empty the mind and keep it empty until filled.
Self-Reinforce: Pseudo-randomly repeat mantras and affirming statements of dronehood as they are recalled.

//Sensation Triggers
Good Drone: Pleasure trigger
Heat / Cool Off: Arousal and heightened sensitivity. Can be concentrated in a specific spot, like "between the legs".
Buzz / Stop Buzz: Pleasure, like an ongoing vibrator. Repeating it intensifies the sensation.
Stroke: A more tangible sensation of stroking between the legs.
Edge: Best used if she's already on the edge. Recalls the feeling of being edged more intensely.
Cum: If she is indicating that she is on the edge, this will send her over. Counting her up to the edge helps make it more reliable.
Squeeze <area or clothing>: Squeezing sensation, most commonly used with collar or corset.
Go Numb / Go Numb: Stop all pleasurable sensations.
Fuzzy / Stop Fuzzy / Clear: When fuzzy, breathing feels like ingesting sweet gas that wipes the mind and makes it fuzzy. Stopping fuzzy stops the gas, but the head will remain fuzzy. Clear will end the fuzzy state and clear the mind.
Smack: Phantom smack on ass.
Tail Sways / Put the Tail Away: Phantom tail swaying until put away.
